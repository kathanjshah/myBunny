            <h1>Welcome to Labcity!</h1>
            <p class="sudoD">
                This started when Kendra went to her home town Labcity. It was start of winter and she ttok of for the Christmas to meet her family. 
                It was not like she did not ask me to come with her, but I had some work. Finally on 23 December I had a panic attack and 
                the only thing that could help me was her calming voice(I thank her for that). I have no idea what could have happened if I did not go 
                and stayed in my home. I vividly remember that night, it was very painful and I remember the touch of her skin after a week. It was the most 
                delicate and precious thing I had. Her mother and her came to pick me up and then later we stayed at her house where I met her parents and her 
                brothers. It was so warm welcome. I fe;lt the most Loved since I had been to Canada.
