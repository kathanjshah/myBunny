            <p class="richoDis">
                A simple implementation of Alex Randolph's board game Ricochet Robots including solver.
                This game is witten in JAVA.<br> Where I learned some of the major algorithms in Computer science, one of such is "Find and hunt" algorithum.<br> Over this I built an AI that can give the solution of the puzzle.
                The most intresting part was to learn how to build the GUI<br> and the "back-end" supporting it. All the updates were done periodically in 4 different Iteration. 
                This Project is hosted on Github,<br> which leads me to learn the version control language, git.
                The whole design was created by me and all the code was led by me.

                Language: Java.<br>
                VERSION CONTROL LANGUAGE: Git<br>
